Wed 5 june.

Running snakemake for quilt phasing on node94 / screen

Running all 171 samples together, batches of 2 Mb, with a time limit of 480 minutes (short queue).
A trial run of 4 samples on chr22 took 10m30s max.  Extrapolating, most but not all batches should finish in time.
I will send the remainder to the medium queue, with a more generous time limit.

I'm getting 176 jobs running in parallel.  Total compute is 8550 CPU hours, @176 in parallel will take ~48 hours.
Then another ~24 perhaps for the laggards.  With luck on Friday I will have data.
